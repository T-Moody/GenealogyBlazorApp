# Documentation and Guide Instructions

## Development Documentation Context

This project follows a comprehensive documentation approach with structured guides and living documentation.

### Key Documentation Files

When working on documentation or referencing project context, always consider these files:

#### Core Documentation

- **DEVELOPMENT_LEDGER.md** (project root): Single source of truth for project evolution
- **DEVELOPMENT_LEDGER_GUIDE.md**: How to maintain the development ledger
- **PROJECT_PHASES_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive development phase guidance
- **AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_GUIDE.md**: How to use the orchestration system
- **ENHANCED_AGENT_USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Updated patterns with orchestration

#### Supporting Guides

- **AGENT_USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Specialist agent usage patterns
- **DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md**: Documentation templates and standards
- **OPERATIONS_SUPPORT_GUIDE.md**: Production readiness and operations
- **BEST_PRACTICES_TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Common issues and solutions

### When to Reference These Files

```

#### During Development

```markdown
"As you work on this:
